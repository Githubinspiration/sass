Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Saas UI ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Saas UI:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/saas-js/saas-ui))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/saas-ui.git
cd saas-ui
```

3. The docs website depends on private packages, if you don't have access to the Pro repository,
   remove `"apps/*",` from `workspaces` in package.json before continuing.

4. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `yarn`. This
   command will install dependencies.

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Saas UI
uses a monorepo structure and we treat each component as an independent package
that can be consumed in isolation.

### Tooling

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage packages and dependecnies
- [TS-UP](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle packages
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and
  testing
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing components and
  hooks
- [Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) for changes
  documentation, changelog generation, and release management.

### Commands

**`yarn`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`yarn storybook`**: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that
end with `.stories.tsx`.

**`yarn build:packages`**: run build for all component packages.

**`yarn test`**: run test for all component packages.

**`yarn changeset`**: add a changeset entry.

**`yarn publish`**: publish changed packages.

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the chakra-ui repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/saas-js/saas-ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
   As you develop, you can run `yarn workspace <module> build` and
   `yarn workspace <module> test` to make sure everything works as expected. Please
   note that you might have to run `yarn` first in order to build all
   dependencies.

4. Run `yarn changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This
   will be used to generate a changelog when we publish an update.
   [Learn more about Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).
   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin main:master` (where
   origin will be your fork on GitHub) before `yarn changeset` works.
5. Also, if you provide `jsx` snippets to the changeset, please turn off the
   live preview by doing the following at the beginning of the snippet:
   ` ```jsx live=false`

> If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc, you can run
> `pnpm changeset add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document
> your changes.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

> Please do not merge code without tests
