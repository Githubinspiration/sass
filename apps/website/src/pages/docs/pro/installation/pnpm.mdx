title: Private NPM using PNPM
description: Install Saas UI Pro components from a private NPM registry.
---

<Info>
  Configuration is slightly different for each package manager, so it's
  important to follow the steps for the package manager you are using in your
  project.
</Info>

### PNPM

In your project root folder you can run this and enter your Github username as user and license key as password.

```bash
pnpm login --registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev/ --scope=@saas-ui
```

Now run `npm i @saas-ui/pro` to install the Pro components.

#### Manual & CI configuration.

The following steps are required to deploy your project or run it on CI.

<Info>
  PNPM expects auth to be base64 encoded, so make sure `SAAS_UI_TOKEN` is
  encoded.
</Info>

```bash
echo -n 'GithubUsername:licenseKey' | base64
```

Add your auth token to shell profile `~/.bash_profile` and add it to environment variables of your deployment or CI.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="base64 encoded token"
```

If you configure this on your local machine, make sure the restart your terminal
or run `source ~/.bash_profile`, to make sure the token is loaded.

<Info>
  If you're having troubles generating a working base64 encoded string, try
  [this website](https://www.base64encode.org/).
</Info>

Then edit `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add the following lines.

```
@saas-ui:registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:_auth="${SAAS_UI_TOKEN}"
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:always-auth=true
```

Now run `pnpm i @saas-ui/pro` to check if the configuration was succesful.
