<Info>
  Configuration is slightly different for each package manager, so it's
  important to follow the steps for the package manager you are using in your
  project.
</Info>

### Yarn

This configuration is for **Yarn 3**, if you are still using Yarn 1.2 it's highly recommended to upgrade.

In the root of your project edit `.yarnrc.yml` and add the following lines.

```yml
npmScopes:
  saas-ui:
    npmRegistryServer: 'https://npm.saas-ui.dev'
npmRegistries:
  //npm.saas-ui.dev:
    npmAuthIdent: '${SAAS_UI_TOKEN:-}'
    npmAlwaysAuth: true
```

To set it up on your dev machine add this to `~/.bash_profile` or your CI configuration.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="GithubUsername:licenseKey"
```

The same configuration can be used for CI and deployments.

Run `yarn add @saas-ui/pro` to see if the configuration was succesful.

If you have issues getting this to work, try base64 encoding your auth token.

```bash
echo -n 'GithubUsername:licenseKey' | base64
```
