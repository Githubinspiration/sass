In case you have redeemed your license key and accepted the Github invite, you should now have access to the Saas UI Pro Git repository.

## Generate from template

You can create a new repository using the Github template feature.

[Generate from template](https://github.com/saas-js/saas-ui-pro/generate)

Make sure you deselect `Include all branches` and create a new `Private` repository.
The new repository will be created with the latest version of Saas UI Pro, and without any commit history.

## Clone the repository

To clone the repository on your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:saas-js/saas-ui-pro.git my-project
```

This will clone the repository into the `my-project` folder, without the commit history.

## Setup Git

Now that you have cloned the repository, you can setup your Git configuration.

The `saas-ui-pro` repository is configured as the `origin` by default,
you can can change this to `upstream` and keep `origin` for your own repository.

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream

git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
```

You can pull the latest changes from the `upstream` repository using the following command:

```bash
git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

As your codebase diverges from `saas-ui-pro` you will run into merge conflicts eventually,
so at some point it might be easier to manually copy over any changes that you want to implement.

## Install dependencies

This project uses `yarn 3` to manage dependencies, you can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

## PNPM support

If you prefer to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`, you need to set up the `pnpm` workspace.

Create `.pnpm-workspace.yaml` in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'saas-ui/*'
```

Then run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Make sure you also update the `scripts` in `package.json` to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`.

## Saas UI base components

The repository includes the source code of the Saas UI Pro base components, which are located in the `saas-ui` folder.
These packages will be installed as part of the workspace. In case you want to install these packages from the private NPM registry,
you can remove the `saas-ui` folder from the workspaces configuration in `package.json`, or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in case you use `pnpm`.

After removing the `saas-ui` folder from the workspaces configuration, you can delete this folder and configure the private NPM registry.
Make sure you also delete the `SaasUIProPlugin` from your Next.js Webpack configuration in `apps/web/next.config.mjs`.
