description: Install Saas UI Pro components from a private NPM registry.
---

In the next steps we'll show you how to install `@saas-ui/pro`.

You'll need a valid license to install `@saas-ui/pro`, you can order one at [saas-ui.dev](https://saas-ui.dev/#pricing).

Before continuing [follow these steps](https://www.saas-ui.dev/docs/getting-started) to set up `@saas-ui/react` and `@chakra-ui/react` in your project, if you haven't done so already.

## Configuration

All pro packages can be installed from our private NPM registry at https://npm.saas-ui.dev.
After [redeeming](https://saas-ui.dev/redeem) your license, an account will be automatically created.

Your NPM account is a combination of the Github username you used to redeem your license and the license code (`username:licenseKey`).

### Yarn

In the root of your project edit `.yarnrc.yml` and add the following lines.

```yml
npmScopes:
  saas-ui:
    npmRegistryServer: 'https://npm.saas-ui.dev'
npmRegistries:
  //npm.saas-ui.dev:
    npmAuthIdent: '${SAAS_UI_TOKEN:-}'
    npmAlwaysAuth: true
```

To set it up on your dev machine add this to `~/.profile`.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="GithubUsername:licenseKey"
```

The same configuration can be used for CI and deployments.

### NPM & PNPM

On your development machine you can run this and enter your Github username as user and license key as password.

```bash
pnpm login --registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev/
```

#### Manual & CI configuration.

Add your auth token to `~/.profile`

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="GithubUsername:licenseKey"
```

Then edit `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add the following lines.

```
@saas-ui:registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:_auth="${SAAS_UI_TOKEN}"
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:always-auth=true
```

##### PNPM

PNPM expects auth to be base64 encoded, so make sure `SAAS_UI_TOKEN` is encoded.

```bash
echo -n 'GithubUsername:licenseKey' | base64
```

If you're having troubles generating a working base64 encoded string, try [this website](https://www.base64encode.org/).
