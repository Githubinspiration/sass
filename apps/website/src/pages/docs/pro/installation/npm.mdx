description: Install Saas UI Pro components from a private NPM registry.
---

In the next steps we'll show you how to install `@saas-ui/pro` in new or existing projects.
You'll need a valid license to install Pro, you can order one at [here](/#pricing).

<Info>
  Before continuing [follow these steps](/docs/core/getting-started) to set up
  `@saas-ui/react` and `@chakra-ui/react` in your project, if you haven't done
  so already.
</Info>

## Configuration

All pro packages can be installed from our private NPM registry at https://npm.saas-ui.dev.
After [redeeming](/redeem) your license, an account will be automatically created.

Your NPM account is a combination of the Github username you used to redeem your license and the license code (`username:licenseKey`).

<Info>
  Configuration is slightly different for each package manager, so it's
  important to follow the steps for the package manager you are using in your
  project.
</Info>

### NPM

In your project root folder you can run this and enter your Github username as user and license key as password.

```bash
npm login --registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev/ --scope=@saas-ui
```

#### Manual & CI configuration.

Add your auth token to `~/.profile` or your CI configuration.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="GithubUsername:licenseKey"
```

Then edit `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add the following lines.

```
@saas-ui:registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:_auth="${SAAS_UI_TOKEN}"
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:always-auth=true
```

Now run `npm i @saas-ui/pro`, if all went well it will now install the pro components.
