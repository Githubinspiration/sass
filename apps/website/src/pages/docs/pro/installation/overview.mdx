Saas UI Pro comes in 2 parts, the base components (`@saas-ui/pro`) and example apps (Next.js, Electron).

The quickest way to get started is by using the Pro Github repository as a template and [creating a copy](https://github.com/saas-js/saas-ui-pro/generate).
This will give you a good starting point for your app and includes the entire setup with base components, example apps and storybooks with code examples.

If you already have a project or want to start from scratch you can install the base components from a privaty NPM registry.
This will also make it easier to keep everything up to date.
