### Package naming

Packages that are prefixed with `app` contain frontend application code. Your UI library related codes lives in `ui` prefixed packages.
API related code lives in `api` prefixed packages.

### Features

Application code is grouped by feature, this means that all related assets, like components, hook, pages are grouped in a single feature folder. This setup will help to keep the code base maintainable as it (and your team) grows. It will make it easier to add/remove new features and prevent any unwanted side effects when refactoring or removing functionality, due to too much interdependencies.

A few rules to make sure the codebase stays maintainable.

- Shared functionality is located in the `common` feature, other features can import from here.
- Treat features as standalone packages, only import from the top-level barrel (index.ts) file. Eg `import { BillingStatus } from '@app/features/billing`.
- If a component is used in multiple features and doesn't depend on external state (like data fetching), consider adding it to the ui library, otherwise add it to the common feature.
- Keep components clean, eg if there is complex business logic, like useQuery or useMutation hooks, move them into a separate hook in `hooks/`
