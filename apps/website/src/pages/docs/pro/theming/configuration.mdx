Saas UI Pro currently comes with one theme that supports custom color schemes. More themes will be added in the future.

## Configure your theme

After installing you'll need to configure the Saas UI Pro theme in order the have all proper styles setup for the components.

```ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

// 1. Import the pro theme
import { theme as proTheme } from '@saas-ui/pro'

// 2. Extend your theme
const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    // your custom theme
  },
  proTheme
)

// 3. Pass the custom theme to SaasProvider
function App() {
  return <SaasProvider theme={theme}>{children}</SaasProvider>
}
```
