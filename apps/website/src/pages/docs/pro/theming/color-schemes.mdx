description: Use the build in color schemes.

Saas UI Pro comes with a helper function that makes it easy to create your own custom color schemes.

The current build-in color schemes next to the base theme are `earth` and `galaxy`.

```ts
// packages/ui-theme/src/theme.ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

import { theme as baseTheme } from '@saas-ui/pro/theme'
import { withThemeColors } from '@saas-ui/pro'

import components from './components'

import colorScheme from './color-schemes/galaxy'

export const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    components,
  },
  /**
   * Uncomment this to use any of the build in color schemes.
   */
  withThemeColors(colorScheme),
  baseTheme
)
```
