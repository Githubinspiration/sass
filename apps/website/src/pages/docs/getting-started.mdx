description: How to get up and running quickly with Saas UI.
---

Saas UI is build on top of Chakra UI, before you continue it's recommended to have a basic understanding of how Chakra UI works. You can find the documentation on the [Chakra UI website](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs).

## Using the starter repository

### Install in an existing project

Inside your React project directory, install Saas UI by running either of the
following:

```bash
npm i @saas-ui/react @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4
```

```bash
yarn add @saas-ui/react @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4
```

### Set up Provider

For Chakra UI to work correctly, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the
root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App({ Component }) {
  // 2. Use at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Component />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```
