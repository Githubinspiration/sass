`@saas-ui/react@1.0.0`

I'm pleased to announce Saas UI Core v1 is officially out! ðŸ¥³

Special thanks to all the early adopters for your feedback and contributions.

The release of Chakra UI 2 and React 18 was a great milestone for the last push of this release.
Moving forward, you can expect more components (DatePicker, Timeline, to name a few), and more examples and starter projects for all popular frameworks.

- [Getting started](/docs/core/quickstarts)
- [Components](/docs/components/auth/auth-provider)

If you have ideas or feedback, feel free to [open an Github issue](https://github.com/saas-js/saas-ui/issues) or come hang out in the new [public Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4PmJGFcAjX).
