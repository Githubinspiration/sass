            we were we looking for a turnkey solution, with enough flexibility.
            SaaS UI is exactly what we were looking for. Eelco is very
            thoughtful. We had factored in that early adopting comes with some
            risk - but so far all any issues are quickly remedied and there are
            almost weekly new useful features for us!”
