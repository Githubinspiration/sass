## Using this repo

The docs website depends on private packages (`@saas-ui/pro`). If you don't have access to the Pro repository,
remove `"apps/*",` from `workspaces` in `package.json` before running `yarn`. This will allow you to install all dependencies,
and run Storybooks for local development.

## Storybook

https://storybook.saas-ui.pro

Or run locally:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Build

```bash
yarn build:packages
```

## Website

Before running the website you need to build the props-docs by running this.

```bash
yarn build:props-docs
```

After that run the website with this command.

```bash
yarn w website dev
```

or

```bash
cd apps/website && yarn dev
```
